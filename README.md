Assignment 1

The source files I am submitting are:
DNA_count.h
DNA_count.cpp
Main.cpp
Kutsanov.txt
These are in the GitHub repository called “Assignment1”.

Most problems I ran into in the code I was able to easily fix by going to stackoverflow. Although I studied over the summer, my knowledge of C++ Is rather limited but I was able to google certain syntax I needed.
